# euler

This repo includes my personal solutions for Project Euler, written in Python as practice.

Solutions to the problems are contained in their own classes, named Euler4, Euler5, Euler6, and so forth, in a central file.

The central solution file may be divided into chunks of 15 problems (or not).
